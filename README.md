# High Scalability, High Availability, High Stability, High Performance, and High Intelligence Back-end Designs

An updated and curated list of selected readings to illustrate best practices in building High Scalability, High Availability, High Stability, High Performance, and High Intelligence back-end systems. Concepts are explained in the articles of prominent engineers and credible references. Case studies are taken from battle-tested systems those are serving millions to billions of users.

#### If your back-end went slow :traffic_light:
> Understand your problems: scalability problem (fast for a single user but slow under heavy load) or performance problem (slow for a single user) by reviewing some [design principles](#principles), then checking how [scalability](#scalability) and [performance](#performance) problems are solved in tech giants. The section of [intelligence](#intelligence) are created for those who work with data and machine learning at big (data) and deep (learning) scale. Also, you can check some [talks](#talks) of elite engineers to know how they build, scale, and optimize their systems.

#### If your back-end went down :construction:
> "Even if you lose all one day, you can build all over again if you retain your calm!" - Thuan Pham, Vietnamese refugee, CTO of Uber Technologies Inc. So, keep calm and mind the [availability](#availability) and [stability](#stability) matters! 

#### If you have an incomming System Design interview :ocean:
> Look at some [interview notes](#interview) and [real-world architectures with completed diagrams](#architectures) to get a comprehensive view before designing your system on whiteboard. There are some selected [books](#books) for you (most of them are free)! Good luck :four_leaf_clover:

#### Community Power :mountain_cableway::aerial_tramway::mountain_cableway:

> Contributions are greatly welcome! You may want to take a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

> If you find this project helpful, please share on your chat groups, [on Twitter](https://ctt.ec/V8B2p), or [on Weibo](http://t.cn/RnjFLCB) so more people can be helped! Power is gained by sharing knowledge, not hoarding it. Thank you! :hibiscus:
